# Deep Learning with Python Study Notes
A stack of study notes for deep learning.
## References
The following textbooks are used for topical references. The book short-form e.g. `DLwP` will be used as the book title reference in chapter descriptions. If you think the notebooks are insufficient for learning / implementation, please refer to the textbook topics directly.

## Chapters

### 2. The Mathematical Building Blocks of Neural Networks
2.1 shows the implementation of a neural network to solve the MNIST problem, a popular classification problem in the deep learning space.

2.2 introduces concepts in neural networks, including tensors, tensor operations (element-wise, dot product, broadcasting, reshaping), mini-batch SGD and backpropogation that are useful to understand how the MNIST problem in 2.1 is solved.

### 3. Getting Started with Neural Networks
3.1 introduces the key concepts of a neural network, including layers, networks, loss functions and optimisers.

3.2 to 3.4 are worked examples in some machine learning examples 

- a binary classification example (the **reviews** problem)
- a multiclass classification example (the **reuters** problem) and 
- a regression example (the **housing prices** problem)
