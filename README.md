## Chapters

### 2. The Mathematical Building Blocks of Neural Networks
2.1 shows the implementation of a neural network to solve the **handwritten-digit** MNIST problem, a popular classification problem in the deep learning space.

2.2 introduces concepts in neural networks, including tensors, tensor operations (element-wise, dot product, broadcasting, reshaping), mini-batch SGD and backpropogation that are useful to understand how the MNIST problem in 2.1 is solved.

### 3. Getting Started with Neural Networks
#### 3.1 - Anatomy of a Neural Network
3.1 introduces the key concepts of a neural network, including layers, networks, loss functions and optimisers.
- `DLwP`
    - Chap 3.1
#### 3.2 - Binary Classification
3.2 is a binary classification example (the **reviews** problem)
- `DLwP`
    - Chap 3.4
#### 3.3 - Multiclass Classification
3.3a is an applied Multiclass Classification on the **reuters** problem. This introuduces the Keras implementation to solve the problem.

3.3b is an another applied Multiclass Classification on the **fashion** problem. This introduces training using `tf2.keras`.

    - Chap 3.5
##### 3.3b
- `HandsML` 
    - Chapter 10
        - Building an Image Classifier Using the Sequential API
#### 3.4 - Regression
3.4 is an applied Regression (the **housing prices** problem) using the Keras implementation. There are both implmentations using Keras and `tf2.keras`. Since the problem involves a small dataset, this problem also involves k-fold validation.
