    "- <b>layers</b> stacked together to form a <b>network</b>\n",
    "- the <b>input data</b> and corresponding <b>targets / responses</b>\n",

Input data is fed to the network for training, and the network uses the loss function to determine the performance of its predictions against the labels. The optimiser then kicks in to tune the model parameters/weights for better predictive power on the training data."
